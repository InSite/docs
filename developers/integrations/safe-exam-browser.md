This article explores the features and benefits of SEB, an open-source tool that has become a cornerstone in securing online assessments for many Shift iQ customers. 

## What is Safe Exam Browser?

Safe Exam Browser, commonly referred to as SEB, is a specialized web browser designed to maintain the integrity of online exams. It restricts the capabilities of the user's device, allowing them to access only pre-authorized websites and applications, effectively preventing cheating and ensuring the security of online exams.

## Key Features of Safe Exam Browser

1. Secure and Customizable Configuration: SEB can be easily configured to meet the specific needs of training providers and educational institutions. It allows administrators to customize settings, such as the list of websites and applications accessible to learners during an exam session. This adaptability makes it an ideal solution for a wide range of assessment scenarios.
    
2. Lockdown Mode: SEB enforces a lockdown mode, where the exam-taker can only access the exam and its associated resources. This prevents learners from browsing the internet, using external applications, or copying/pasting content, thereby minimizing opportunities for cheating.
    
3. Multi-Platform Compatibility: Safe Exam Browser is compatible with various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. This multi-platform support allows organizations to utilize SEB regardless of their technical infrastructure.
    
4. Integration with Learning Management Systems (LMS): SEB can be seamlessly integrated with popular Learning Management Systems, such as Shift iQ, Moodle, Canvas, and Blackboard. This simplifies exam administration and allows training providers and educators to control and monitor exams from a central platform.
    
5. Enhanced Security: SEB offers robust security features to protect exams from unauthorized access. These include password protection, encryption, and network lockdown, making it exceptionally difficult for learners to cheat or manipulate the exam environment.
    

## Benefits of Safe Exam Browser

1. Maintains Assessment Security and Integrity: SEB is a powerful tool for maintaining the security of online assessments by limiting learners' access to external resources during an exam session.

4. Cross-Platform Compatibility: The ability to run on multiple operating systems makes SEB accessible to a broader range of educational institutions. It does not exclude schools based on their existing technology infrastructure.
    
5. Easy Integration: SEB seamlessly integrates with popular Learning Management Systems, streamlining the exam administration process and making it easier for educators to manage and monitor assessments.
    
6. Learner Privacy and Security: SEB protects learners' privacy by ensuring their devices are not compromised during exams. It does not access personal information or interfere with the functionality of the device outside the exam environment.
    
7. Open Source and Cost-Efficient: One of the most significant advantages of SEB is that it is open source and freely available, making it a cost-effective solution for educational institutions with limited budgets.
