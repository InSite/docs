# Power BI

Power BI is Microsoft's business intelligence and data visualization platform. In simplest terms, it is a report builder â€” and a very good one. It is designed to make reporting accessible to business users, not just technical experts.

Many of our customers use Power BI to extract, analyze, and report data from the system. Here is a quick guide to help you get started.

If you do not see a Developer Settings panel then contact your LMS administrator to have this enabled for your account.
