# Date and time values

The API stores date/time values in Microsoft SQL Server using the [DATETIMEOFFSET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/data-types/datetimeoffset-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16) data type, and in PostgreSQL using the [timestamp with time zone](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/datatype-datetime.html) data type.&#x20;

## Why is explicit time zone information is so important?

Consider the following date/time value for example:

**2025-11-02 01:30 AM**

The exact meaning of this value is ambiguous. In Canada and the United States, Daylight Savings Time (DST) ends on November 2, 2025 at 2:00 AM. At that moment, clocks are set back one hour. Therefore, the hour from 1:00 AM to 2:00 AM occurs twice:

* First, under Eastern Daylight Time (EDT, UTC-4)
* Then again, under Eastern Standard Time (EST, UTC-5)

Furthermore, without a time zone or UTC offset specified, the value might also represent:

* November 2, 2025 at 5:30 AM UTC in Europe/London
* November 1, 2025 at 10:30 PM Mountain Standard Time in Canada/Calgary
* November 1, 2025 at 11:30 PM Mountain Daylight Time in America/Phoenix (no DST)
* November 1, 2025 at 10:30 PM Pacific Daylight Time in America/Los Angeles

In contrast, consider the following date/time offset value:

**2025-11-01T22:30:00-07:00**

In contrast to the previous example, the exact meaning of this value is **not** ambiguous. It can be interpreted one way only:

* November 1, 2025 at 10:30 PM Mountain Standard Time, as observed in Canada/Calgary and in America/Denver

It cannot be interpreted to mean any other day, or time, or time zone.

Explicitly including time zone awareness — i.e., embedding it in a single atomic value with the date and time — ensures every date/time value includes the calendar date, the time of day (based on a 24-hour clock), and the time zone offset (based on Coordinated Universal Time).&#x20;

In turn, this guarantees the precise meaning of a value is never ambiguous with regard to time zone or (where applicable) rules about daylight savings time.

### Other benefits of using date/time offset values with time zone awareness

* Converting between time zones is predictable and accurate, enabling clear transformations and comparisons across systems with different time zones and/or daylight saving time rules.
* Representing specific moments in time globally can be done quickly and easily. Two different values with two different offsets can still be compared meaningfully and reliably by internally converting both to UTC.
* Logging, auditing, and monitoring in distributed systems where clients and servers operate in different time zones require unambiguous timestamps.
* Aligning with formal standards and industry best practices found in other modern APIs is especially important for data serialization. This is critical for reliable communication between systems that need to exchange time-based data across platform boundaries.

## ISO 8601

The API uses the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format for all date/time values.&#x20;

This format is often referred to as the **round-trip format** in data serialization contexts because it guarantees a date/time value can be:

* **Serialized** (converted to a string), and then
* **Deserialized** (parsed back to the original object)

with **zero loss** of information.

### Key characteristics enabling round-trip accuracy

This round-trip format has several important characteristics:

| **Full date-time precision**  | Includes year, month, day, hour, minute, second, fractional seconds (optional).               |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Time zone offset**          | Encodes the UTC offset (e.g., `-07:00`, `+00:00`, or `Z` for UTC), preserving global context. |
| **Unambiguous format**        | Uses fixed patterns like `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssK`, where `K` includes the offset.               |
| **Invariant across cultures** | Not affected by locale settings (e.g., no "AM/PM", no localized month names).                 |

## The round-trip format

In .NET, the ISO 8601 format corresponds to the "O" (round-trip) or "o" format specifier for function calls to `DateTimeOffset.ToString()`.

.NET follows the ISO 8601 standard with this pattern:

`yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffffffK`

where:

* `yyyy-MM-dd` is the date
* `T` is the literal separator between date and time
* `HH:mm:ss` is the time in 24-hour format
* `.fffffff` is the fractional seconds (if present)
* `K` is the offset from UTC

To recap, this format is culture-invariant and unambiguous, making it ideal for data exchange, serialization, and storage scenarios where it is necessary to preserve the exact calendar date, time of day, and time zone for a specific moment in time.

### Data examples

Here are a few examples that show ISO 8601 values and their corresponding local times:

| ISO 8601 Date/Time          | Local Time                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `2025-10-31T23:00:00-07:00` | October 31, 2025 11:00 PM MST  |
| `2025-07-01T12:00:00-07:00` | July 1, 2025 12:00 PM PDT      |
| `2025-12-25T10:00:00-05:00` | December 25, 2025 10:00 AM EST |
| `2025-03-10T01:30:00-07:00` | March 10, 2025 1:30 AM MST     |
| `2025-09-15T16:15:00-07:00` | September 15, 2025 4:15 PM PDT |

### Code examples

In .NET, the `"o"` or `"O"` format specifier produces a string like this:

```csharp
DateTimeOffset original = DateTimeOffset.Parse("2025-11-01T22:30:00-07:00");
string serialized = original.ToString("o");  // "2025-11-01T22:30:00.0000000-07:00"
DateTimeOffset parsed = DateTimeOffset.Parse(serialized);
```

> ✅ `parsed == original` — the round-trip is **lossless**
