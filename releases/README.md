# July 9: Version 25.4

This next update introduces a series of small but meaningful improvements that reflect ongoing enhancements to the platform, along with feedback we’ve received from customers. Each change is designed to improve visibility, reduce unnecessary steps, and give you more control across key workflows.

Here's a quick look at what’s new:

* New sort and export options on group membership lists
* Streamlined workflows for registrations and memberships
* Improved safeguards when deleting assessment banks
* Access to developer API keys through self-serve tools
* Updated tracking and reporting in Logbooks
* Better visibility for standalone assessments on the Learner Dashboard

These updates support more efficient administration and make key features easier to use across the platform.&#x20;
