# Versions

Just like smartphones have evolved from basic devices to powerful computers, eLearning standards have grown more sophisticated over time. Understanding this evolution helps you make smart decisions about which standards to support and when to upgrade your training technology.

### The SCORM family tree

#### SCORM 1.0 (January 2000)

**Status:** Historical only\
**What it was:** The first rough draft of what would become SCORM. Think of it as the prototype that proved the concept could work.\
**Our recommendation:** Ignore it completely - no one uses this anymore.

#### SCORM 1.1 (January 2001)

**Status:** Obsolete\
**What it was:** The first version that actually worked, but with many rough edges that needed smoothing.\
**Our recommendation:** If you find old content in this format, it's time to upgrade.

#### SCORM 1.2 (October 2001)

**Status:** Still widely used\
**What it was:** The version that made SCORM famous and widely adopted across the industry.\
**What makes it special:** Reliable, simple, and works with virtually every LMS on the market.\
**Our recommendation:** **Essential support.** This is still the workhorse of the eLearning industry. If you're just getting started with SCORM, begin here.

#### SCORM 2004 Editions (2004-2009)

**Status:** Widely supported\
**What they added:** Advanced navigation controls and course sequencing - think of it as giving course authors the ability to create "if-then" rules for learner progress.

**The editions you'll encounter:**

* **2nd Edition (2004):** Fixed major problems from the 1st edition
* **3rd Edition (2006):** Most widely used version of SCORM 2004
* **4th Edition (2009):** Latest and most refined version

**Our recommendation:** Support **3rd or 4th Edition** if you need advanced course navigation features. Otherwise, SCORM 1.2 is often sufficient.

### Beyond SCORM: Other standards you should know

#### AICC HACP (1998)

**The veteran standard that refuses to retire**

**Why it matters:** AICC was doing eLearning standards before SCORM existed, and it's still valuable today.\
**Key advantage:** Works when your training content and LMS are hosted on different domains (which SCORM struggles with).\
**Our recommendation:** Keep supporting this - it's still the second most common standard after SCORM 1.2.

#### xAPI/Tin Can API (2013)

**The modern alternative designed for today's learning**

**What makes it different:**

* Tracks learning that happens outside your LMS (mobile apps, simulations, on-the-job activities)
* Records detailed learning analytics in natural language ("Sarah completed Advanced Safety Training")
* Works across all devices and platforms

**Perfect for:**

* Mobile learning initiatives
* Tracking informal learning and performance support
* Games and simulations
* Blended learning programs

**Our recommendation:** Consider adopting if you want to track learning beyond traditional courses or if mobile learning is important to your strategy.

#### cmi5 (2016)

**xAPI's business-friendly companion**

**What it is:** Combines the advanced tracking of xAPI with the familiar course structure of SCORM.\
**Why it exists:** Gives you xAPI benefits while working like traditional LMS courses.\
**Our recommendation:** Ideal if you want to modernize your tracking capabilities without completely changing how you manage courses.

#### IMS Common Cartridge (2008)

**The academic world's answer to SCORM**

**Designed for:** Higher education rather than corporate training\
**Includes:** Discussion forums, question banks, and other classroom-style learning tools\
**Our recommendation:** Only relevant if you work in academic institutions or provide training to universities.

#### IMS LTI (2010)

**The plug-and-play standard for educational tools**

**What it does:** Allows your LMS to seamlessly connect with external learning tools and applications\
**Common in:** Academic settings and university LMSs\
**Our recommendation:** Important if you work in education; less relevant for corporate training environments.

### Making smart choices: Which standards should you support?

#### **For most organizations (start here):**

1. **SCORM 1.2** - Your foundation. Nearly universal compatibility.
2. **AICC HACP** - Your backup plan for hosting flexibility.

#### **If you want very advanced features:**

3. **SCORM 2004 3rd or 4th Edition** - For complex course navigation and prerequisites.

#### **If you're forward-thinking:**

4. **xAPI + cmi5** - For comprehensive learning analytics and modern learning experiences.

#### **Special situations:**

* **Academic institutions:** Add IMS LTI support
* **Content hosted separately from LMS:** Prioritize AICC HACP
* **Mobile-heavy training:** Invest in xAPI capabilities

### Bonus: Standards that make your life easier

#### PENS (Package Exchange Notification Services)

**The one-click publishing solution**

**Problem it solves:** Eliminates the tedious process of manually uploading courses to your LMS\
**How it works:** Direct publishing from authoring tools to your LMS with a single click\
**Our recommendation:** Adopt this if you regularly import lots of content - it's a huge time-saver.

### What's the bottom line?

You don't need to support every standard, but having a clear strategy helps you make smart technology investments. Most successful training organizations start with solid SCORM 1.2 support and gradually add other standards based on their specific needs and learner requirements.

**Questions about which standards are right for your organization?** We're here to help you navigate these decisions without the technical complexity.
