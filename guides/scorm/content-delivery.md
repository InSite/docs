# Content delivery

### What is SCORM?

SCORM (Sharable Content Object Reference Model) is a technical standard that acts as a universal language between online courses and Learning Management Systems. Think of it as a translator that ensures any course created with any popular authoring tool (like Articulate or Captivate) will work seamlessly on your LMS - regardless of which company made either product.&#x20;

A SCORM package is basically a course contained in a standard ZIP file that includes all the necessary components, making the course portable and reusable across different platforms. This means you can create a course once and use it on multiple systems, or switch to a new LMS without losing your existing training content.

In addition, SCORM automatically tracks learner progress consistently across different systems. When learners take a SCORM course, the standard ensures completion status, quiz scores, and time spent are accurately recorded and reported, no matter what LMS hosts and/or delivers the content. This prevents vendor lock-in and gives organizations the flexibility to choose the best tools for their needs without worrying about compatibility issues.&#x20;

While SCORM is a technical standard that focuses on how different eLearning software components communicate with each other, its impact is practical: it makes distributing, managing, and updating training materials more efficient while ensuring learners have a consistent experience across all platforms.

### SCORM content delivery in Shift iQ

Shift iQ is an Learning Management System (LMS) and a Learning Record Store (LRS), and it offers full support for SCORM-compliant content.&#x20;

There are many different platforms available to manage and host your library of SCORM packages. By design, the SCORM standard is platform-agnostic, so you can use whatever platform best suits the needs of your organization. Here are just a few recommendations:

#### SCORM Cloud

Rustici Software is a leading provider of eLearning technology solutions, best known for creating [SCORM Cloud](../), a comprehensive web-based service for SCORM content testing, delivery, and management. SCORM Cloud allows organizations and developers to quickly test their eLearning courses for SCORM compliance, host content with (or without) their own LMS infrastructure, and integrate SCORM tracking capabilities into existing systems through a robust API.&#x20;

SCORM Cloud is an excellent testing ground for course developers who want to ensure their content works properly before deployment, and a hosting solution for organizations that need to deliver SCORM content without building their own implementation of the SCORM standard.&#x20;

Shift iQ integrates seamlessly with SCORM Cloud, so you can deliver courses in the Shift LMS directly from the course library in your SCORM Cloud account.

#### Moodle

[Moodle](https://moodle.org/) is one of the world's most popular open-source Learning Management Systems, serving millions of learners across educational institutions, businesses, and organizations globally. As a SCORM-compliant LMS, Moodle provides robust [support for SCORM packages](https://docs.moodle.org/500/en/SCORM_activity), allowing users to upload and deploy SCORM content created with any authoring tool. The platform handles SCORM 1.2 and SCORM 2004 standards, automatically tracking learner progress, completion status, and assessment scores within its gradebook system.&#x20;

If your organization is already using Moodle to manage and host your library of SCORM packages, then you can leverage the integration between Shift iQ and Moodle to deliver your SCORM content in either LMS. Some organizations use Moodle only to manage their library of SCORM content, and then use the Shift iQ LMS to deliver the content to learners and track their progress.

#### Scoop

[Scoop](https://openscorm.com/scoop) is a new, open-source alternative to SCORM Cloud for hosting your library of SCORM packages. It is less expensive than SCORM Cloud, and much easier to use than Moodle, so it's an excellent option if simplicity and affordability are high priorities for your organization.&#x20;

Shift iQ integrates seamlessly with Scoop. Thanks to its Single Sign On feature with your Shift iQ login credentials, adding a SCORM package to a learning activity in a Shift iQ course takes only a few mouse-clicks.
