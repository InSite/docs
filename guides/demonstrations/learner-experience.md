## Sample organization overview

Our team has configured a sample organization for demo and training purposes. You can use this to familiarize yourself with the system and experiment with various features.

The sample organization is named Safety Training Authority (STA). It has several sample courses.  organization contains several  courses. A typical learner interacts with the course content by following a simple sequence of steps:

1. Browse the course catalogue
2. Enroll in a course
3. Complete learning materials and/or assessments
4. Download achievements from the dashboard

In addition to allowing your learners to browse your e-learning catalogue for self-directed online learning, you can also create a schedule of classroom training sessions and exam events  — which might be online or in-person — and allow your learners to browse the schedule and register for available seats.

Here, for example, here an administrator has published a library of online courses (Course Catalog) as well as event registrations (Enroll in a Course) in the learning portal:
