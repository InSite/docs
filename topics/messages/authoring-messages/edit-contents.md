# Editing and Formatting Message Contents

Add your message content here using the Shift iQ markdown Content Authoring tool, designed to be fast, light, and easy to use. This tool helps create content thatâ€™s less likely to be marked as spam, making it more likely that your messages will reach your email subscribers.

The Markdown toolbar buttons can be used to quickly format text, or you can simply add the correct markdown language manually. Here is what the buttons do:
* **B** bolds or *I* italisizes the selected text
* **H** makes a line of text into a heading with larger, bolded, font, and space before and after that line; each click of **H** button changes the Heading level, from level 1 (largest font) to level 6 (smallest font)
* **"** makes a line of text into a quote
* the bullet and numbered list buttons can be used to make a generic or numbered lists
* the **Create Link** button is used to insert a link placeholder, which must then be edited to insert the link text and the link itself
* the **Insert Image** button is used to insert an image placeholder, which must then be edited to insert the image text and a link to where the image itself is stored (requires access to the Assets toolkit); alternatively, use drag and drop or the **selecting** link shown at the bottom of the content editor to add images
* the **Toggle Preview** button (eyeball) changes your markdown text to what it will look like when saved
* the **Toggle Side by Side** button (double pane) opens a double pane view in full screen mode with the markdown editor on the left and the preview view on the right
* the **Full Screen** button (arrow box) opens the markdown editor in full screen mode, or returns it to the normal view
* the **Markdown Guide** button (question mark) opens a simple markdown guide with additional options
