* **Newsletter:**  This can be used to send News, Updates or Reminders to users
* **Notification:** Notifications can be sent to users for different reasons (Do NOT use for general communication). 
   **Example:**
   - Reminder to complete a survey
   - Confirmation of exam registration
   - Failed Login Attempts
