## Seats with Multiple Price Levels
When creating seats for a Class, different price levels can be created for different users in your Organization (Example:  Members pay less than non-members).
Only users that are in the Employer group, with the Group Status specified in the seat setup, will be able to see the seat price being created. 

Under **Seat Price**, select the **Multiple Price Levels** option, and add the following information:
* **Price Name:**  The name of the seat, this will be visible to the user when registering for a class. 
* **Price Amount:**  The cost of the seat.
* **Group Status:**  Select the Group Status you are creating the seat for.
	* The **Group Status** field is linked to the Group Status added to an **Employer** group. If none of your **Employer** groups have a **Group Status** set, there will be **no** options availabel to select in this field during seat creation.
	* Please see <a href="/ui/help/portal/contacts/group-management/adding-new-group" target="_blank">**Create a New Group**</a> for instruction on how to create a new Employer group. 
* Click the **Add Price** button to save your changes.
* Repeat the above steps to create all different levels of seats required for the Class.
