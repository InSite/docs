# How to use the Assessment Toolkit

Creating an Assessment Form involves a structured approach. Below, you’ll find a summary of the steps to follow in order to create your Assessment Form. This workflow will guide you through adding questions to your question bank, creating a clear specification for your assessment, and then using that specification to build a well-organized and effective Assessment Form.

### Step 1. [Create a Bank and Add Questions to it](./)

* **Develop or Gather Questions:** Start by creating or gathering all the potential questions you might want to include in the assessment. These could be based on a specific topic, skill, or criteria that the assessment is targeting.
* **Question Types:** Include various question types (e.g., Multiple Choice, Multiple Correct, True/False, Composed Response, or Likert scale).
* **Scoring System:** Specify the scoring system for each question (e.g., 1 point for a correct answer, 0 points for an incorrect answer, etc.).
* **Organize the Questions:** It’s helpful to organize questions into Sets based on the skills they assess.
* **Tagging:** Tag questions with relevant keywords, such as competency code (e.g., A1, B2). This makes it easier to when building a specifications for your bank.

### Step 2. [Create a Specification](../../../help/assessments/specifications-forms/)

* **Choose your Specification Type:**
  * **Dynamic:** A form with this specification does not have a fixed set of questions. If two learners start an attempt on this type of form, then each learner may be presented with a different set of questions and/or questions in a different sequence.
  * **Static:** A form with this specification has a fixed set of questions in a fixed sequence, which is determined by the author of the form. Every learner who starts an attempt on form with a Static specification sees exactly the same set of questions in exactly the same sequence.
* **Total Number of Questions:** How many questions will be included in the assessment?
* **Set the Filter Type:** Select how you want to filter questions for the Assessment Form.
  * **Include All Questions:** Include all of the questions in the set.
  * **Question Tag Filter:** Filter the questions in the set so that only those with matching tags are included.
* **Set your Question limit per Set:** Specify how many questions from each Set in your question bank you want to add to your Form.
* **Weighting of Questions:** If some questions are more important than others, decide how to weight them (e.g., certain questions might be worth more points or more time to answer).
* **Specify Conditions for Success:** Define the thresholds or criteria for passing or success in the assessment. For instance, what score or percentage constitutes a passing grade?

### Step 3. [Create Your Assessment Form](../../../help/assessments/specifications-forms/creating-a-form/)

* **Select Questions from the Question Bank:** Depending on the specification you created in step 2, choose questions from the question bank that match the required criteria.
* **Set the Time Limit:** How much time will be given to complete the assessment, if applicable.
* **Set Attempt Limit:** This is the maximum number of times each person is permitted attempt this exam.
* **Include Instructions:** Provide clear instructions at the start of the assessment form.
* **Publish the Form**
