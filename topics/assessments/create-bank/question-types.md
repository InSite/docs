# Choosing Question Types

Shift iQ allows for a wide variety of assessment question types, including multiple choice, true/false, multiple correct, composed response (voice recording or typed essay), drag-and-drop reordering, matching, hotspot and Likert.

* **Multiple Choice:** Allows the learner to select one correct answer from multiple options, such as Multiple Choice and True/False questions.
* **Multiple Correct:** Allows the learner to select multiple answers from multiple options. There are various calculation methods for Multiple Correct question types:
  * **All or Nothing** This should be used when the total score being awarded for that question will not be split between options. If the candidate does not select all the correct options, the candidate will not get any points. When selecting the **All or Nothing** calculation method, the total points awarded for the question (1 point) is divided equally to all answer options (correct and incorrect). When a learner answers the question, and they select the correct answer options (B and D in the screenshot), they will receive 0.25 for each correct answer and they will also receive 0.25 for not selecting the 2 incorrect answers (A and C in the screenshot). The total points awarded for their answer will be 1 point. ![all-or-nothing.png](https://e02.insite.com/files/sites/e02/question-types/all-or-nothing.png) If the learner selects a correct and incorrect answer (example A and B) or select the correct answers and incorrect answer (example A, B and D), no points will be awarded to the learner for the question.\

  * **Equally Weighted** This should be used when all the options are correct, the points awarded to the question will be divided equally among all the options. When selecting the **Equally Weighted** calculation method, the total points awarded for the question (1 point) is divided equally to all answer options (correct and incorrect). When a learner answers the question, and they select the correct answer options (A, B and C in the screenshot), they will receive 0.25 for each correct answer and they will also receive 0.25 for not selecting the the incorrect answer (D in the screenshot). The total points that will be awarded for their answer will be 1 point. ![equally-weighted.png](https://e02.insite.com/files/sites/e02/question-types/equally-weighted.png) If the learner selects correct and incorrect answers (example A, B and D) or select all the correct answers and the incorrect answer (example A, B, C and D), points will only be awarded to the correct answers selected. No points will be given for the incorrect answer selected. _E.g. Learner selects A, B and D, points will be awarded for A and B, scoring the learner 0.50 for their answer, no score awarded for D._\

  * **Correct Minus Incorrect** This option should be used where points will be deducted where the candidate selects a wrong option. When selecting the **Correct Minus Incorrect** calculation method, the total points awarded for the question (1 point) is divided equally to all answer options (correct and incorrect). When a learner answers the question, and they select the correct answer options (A, B and C in the screenshot), they will receive 0.25 for each correct answer and they will also receive 0.25 for not selecting the the incorrect answer (D in the screenshot). The total points that will be awarded for their answer will be 1 point.\

  * **Limited Correct** With this option, the candidate is limited to the number of options that can be selected. If there are 2 correct answers, the candidate will only be able to select 2 answers. When selecting the **Limited Correct** calculation method, the total points awarded for the question (1 point) is divided equally between the correct answer options. When a learner answers the question, and they select the correct answer options (A and B in the screenshot), they will receive 0.50 for each correct answer. The total points that will be awarded for their answer will be 1 point. ![limited-correct.png](https://e02.insite.com/files/sites/e02/question-types/limited-correct.png) If the learner selects a correct and incorrect answer (example A and C), points will only be awarded for the correct answer selected and no points for the incorrect answer.
