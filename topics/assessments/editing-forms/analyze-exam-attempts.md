# Manually Analyze Assessment Attempts

**When an Assessment Attempt is submitted, the system automatically Analyzes a users attempt. During the Analyze process, the following occurs:**
1. Sets final score, i.e. Pass or Fail.
2. Sets attempt tag from Venue Location Name (if being used).
3. Updates comments in Assessment from Attempt (if comments for learners are enabled).
4. Saves scores to the gradebook (if an Gradebook is attached to the Assessment Bank and Form).

Assessment Attempts with Composed Essay question types need to be Graded by an administrator after the user submits their Assessment Attempt. 
After grading the Composed Essay questions, the administrator needs to click the Analyze button to instruct the system to go through Analyze steps mentioned above.  

When doing a **Force Complete** for an uncompleted Assessment Attempt, an Administrator can click the Analyze button to instruct the system to go throught the analyze process.
