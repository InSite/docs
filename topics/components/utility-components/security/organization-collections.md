When creating a New Document on the portal, there are 6 types of documents that is on the New Document list by default:

* Competency Clustering

We are able to customize this list for Orginazations so they they only see the document types they are using.

In the **Accounts** Toolkit, open the **Orginazations** counter and search for the Orginaztation you would like to update the list for.

Under the **Collections** tab, select **Standards/Document/Type** from the dropdown menu below the **Collection** field.

Click on the Plus icon \<i class="fa fa-plus-circle" aria-hidden="true">\</i> next to the Item field, this will create the text boxes where you can enter the document types required by the Orginazation. After adding the required documents, click **Save**.

Only the documents you added to the **Standards/Document/Type** list will appear in the New Document field on the portal.
