## Notes on Proper Hierarchy for Sites

A Page can be created within a Folder (**Folder -> Page** <i class="fa-check">:check:</i>) Blocks can be created within a Page (**Page -> Block** <i class="fa-check">:check:</i>) A Page can be created within a Folder and a Block can be created within a Page (**Folder -> Page -> Block** <i class="fa-check">:check:</i>) Folders can be created within a Folder, and contain Pages and Blocks (**Folder -> Folder -> Page -> Blocks** <i class="fa-check">:check:</i>)

Blocks can **not** be created within a Folder (**Folder -> Block** <i class="fa-times">:times:</i>) A Page should **not** be created within another Page (**Page -> Page** <i class="fa-times">:times:</i>), as users will not be able to easily navigate deeply nested site pages.\
