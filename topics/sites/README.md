# Sites

Easily create, edit, and expand portal content for your users with our Web Sites toolkit. Add custom or stock images to portal tiles for a visually appealing experience. Set privacy at any level to ensure only specific users or groups can access the content. External public-facing web sites can also be created and hosted here, simplifying the administration of your various sites (see www.insite.com for an example).
