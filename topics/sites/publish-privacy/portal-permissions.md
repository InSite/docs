# Portal Permissions

**Groups** in the **Contacts** toolkit can be used to set the access permissions on the Organization **Portal**. If no **Groups** has been created or new groups are required, it can be added in the **Contacts** toolkit,  using **Groups** (See <a href="/ui/help/portal/contacts/adding-new-group" target="_blank">**Create a New Group**</a>). Once a **Group** has been created, and users were added to the group,  go to the **Site** Toolkit and navigate to your portal Folder/Page where the permissions need to be added.

Under the **Page Setup** tab click on the **Privacy** tab and then click on the Pencil Icon <i class="fas fa-pencil-alt"></i> next to the **Groups** field.

In the **Filter** card, select the **Group Type** (Department, District, Employer, List, Role, Team, Venue) and then in the **Update Groups** card select the groups that are allowed to the see the content of the Folder/Page.

Click the Save button to save your changes.

*Note:  You are able to give permissions to different **Group Types** for the same **Folder/Page**.
e.g. A combination of **Groups** withing a **Role** and within a **List** can be added to the permission list of a **Foler/Page**.*
