# Adding Links

You are able to add web links or email addresses in the text of your content.

When you click the **Create Link** button, the system will insert the outline needed for the link . Between the square brackets, add the text you want to be displayed. Copy and Paste or type the webpage you want the user to be directed to.  Example of what the link will look like:  [Shift iQ](https://www.shiftiq.com). In your page content, the link will display as [Shift iQ](https://www.shiftiq.com/). The user can click on the text and will be directed to the webpage you added.

You are able to configure the link with an email address instead. You can either add a email address between the square brackets or text. Instead of adding a website, you remove the http:// and add [mailto:add email address.](mailto:support@shiftiq.com.) The full link will be [Click Here to Email](mailto:support@shiftiq.com) or [support@shiftiq.com](mailto:support@shiftiq.com). The text will display as [Click Here to Email](mailto:support@shiftiq.com) or [support@shiftiq.com](mailto:support@shiftiq.com)

#### Open Link in New Browser Window:

If you require the link you are inserting to open on in a new browser window, you can us the following link:\
\<a href="url or link to file" target="\_blank">text to display\</a>

An example of the full link will be:\
\<a href="http://www.insite.com" target="\_blank">InSite Information Systems\</a>\
The text will display as [InSite Information Systems](http://www.insite.com/) and when you click on the text it will open the web page in a new browser window.
