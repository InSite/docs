# Changing URLs and Page Slugs

<span style="color:red">**Be careful when editing existing URLs: if you have linked or referenced the URL somewhere else and edit it, the link will no longer work.**</span> However, sometimes the automatically generated segment when creating content is longer than it needs to be as it is built from the Title you give the page.

If youâ€™d like to adjust a **URL Segment**, you can do so under the **Page Setup** tab. Under the **Details** tab within the **Page Setup** tab, click on the Pencil Icon <i class="fas fa-pencil-alt"></i>  next to the **Page Slug (URL Segment)** field, under the **Navigation** heading. 

On the Update **Navigation** card, in the **Page Slug (URL Segment**) field update/change the URL. 

Click the **Save** button to save your changes.

*Please note that when you update a Folder/Page **URL Segment**, each Folder/Page needs to have its own unique **URL Segement**. Folders/Pages **cannot** share the same **URL Segement**.*

**Example:** Changing URL Segment from **changing-webpage-url-segment** to **change-url**
This will change the webpage URL from **www.example.ca/changing-webpage-url-segment** to **www.example.ca/change-url**
