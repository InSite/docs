# Overview

Surveys enable you to collect information from *your* Users. Surveys can be used to gather opinions or experience (for example, a course evaluation or customer feedback). They can also be used as application forms, and data gathered in the application can update fields in the contact record. Survey responses can be anonymous, or connected to a contact.
