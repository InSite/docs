# Terminating a Survey

Navigate to the Survey Termination options by clicking in the Details panel, choose **Terminate Survey** as Question Type. Click **Save**

**Tip:** Surveys do not display text written in a terminate survey question box.  To enter text to terminate a survey, the user must first put a break question with desired text then an empty **Terminate Survey** question.

**Note:** Skip patterns skip to pages, not questions. When you have a skip to a terminate survey question, it skips to the top of the page that holds the terminate survey button. A survey participant will have to view every question on that page before the survey terminates.
