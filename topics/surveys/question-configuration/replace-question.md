# Replacing a Survey Question in an existing Survey

After a question has been created, you are not able to change the **Question Type**. This is to prevent data loss in case someone has answered the survey already. 
If you want to change the **Question Type** of an existing question, you need to delete the original question and then create a new question with the new **Question Type** in its place.  

***Note:** Before deleting the existing question, note any attributes it has that you might need to carry forward to your new question (e.g. Settings, Respondent Attribute, Answer Options and Settings). The most important field to take note of is the **Question #**. You need the **Question #** of the **existing** survey question to enter in the **Question #** field of the new replacement question you are creating.*

* Identify the Question you want to replace and click on the Edit pencil icon (<i class="fas fa-pencil"></i>);
* Make note of the Question # (and any other attributes you want to reuse in the new question);
* Create your new question, by clicking on the Add Question button at the top of the page, and add the existing Question # in the new questions Question # field; 
* Add the content for your new Survey Question and click the Save button.
* Delete the existing Survey Question you wanted to replace.

Once a survey is active, and a question or answer option needs to be updated/replaced/removed, it is better to create a new Survey.**</span>
