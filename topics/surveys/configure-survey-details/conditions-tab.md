# Conditions Tab

Add conditional logic to your survey.  This function hides a question on a subsequent page based on the answers of an earlier page (in case the condition is met or not met).

If Conditions have been enabled, you will see this icon <i class="far fa-code-branch"></i>  beside the survey questions. 

How to add an condidtion:
* Under the **Conditions tab**, click on the **Add Conditions** button.
* Select the question for which you want to define conditional logic so that another question on the survey is suppressed, depending upon the respondent's answer to it.
* Select the answer field value that will cause one or more subsequent questions to be supressed. You can suppress only questions that appear on subsequent pages. You cannot supress questions on the same page.
* Select the question that should be suppressed when a respondent selects the above answer field value.
* Click **Add Condidtion** button.

You must remove all responses before you can edit skip patterns, conditions, or branches.  Remove responses under the Edit Survey/Details tab.
