# Translations Tab

Under the **Translations** tab, you will be able to see the the language your Survey was translated to. If there is not translation, it will show None under **Translate To**.

The **Translate** button at the top of the page enables you to set the language and translation features of the survey (if necessary). Surveys must be authored in English.  Once the English version is complete, you can translate it into another language.  

Select the **Translate** button in the **Survey** and then select the language you would like to translate your survey into.

The translations are generated by Google Translate and automatically populated into the fields.  Edit and replace as necessary.

Please contact [**Shift iQ Support**](mailto:support@insite.com) if you are unsure whether your account has been set up for multi-language surveys.
