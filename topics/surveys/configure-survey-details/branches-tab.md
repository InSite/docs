# Branches Tab

The Branches tab shows a summary of the skip patterns contained in the survey.

Set up skip patterns by editing the answer options for the question you want to branch off. Skip patterns will be displayed on the Branches tab but cannot be edited on the Branches tab.

When actively editing a survey, you should check here periodically for errors or warnings.

You must remove all responses before you can edit skip patterns, conditions, or branches. Remove responses under the Edit Survey/Details tab.
