# Creating survey forms

To create a new survey form, click on the **Surveys** toollkit on the Admin Home Screen, then select the **Survey** counter.

Click on **Add New Survey** at the top of the Survey search page.

Select the **Internal Name** (Required) for your survey. The internal name is used as a reference for filing purposes. It is required, but it is not visible to the survey respondent.

Select **Limit Responses per Respondent**, **Allow Anonymous Responses** and **Confidentiality for Respondents** settings for the Survey.

* **Limit Responses per Respondent**
  * Limited - Allows respondents to answer the survey only once, but also allows identification of respondent. The Start Survey button goes away once a respondent has taken the survey once. To allow them to take it again, you must either:
    * Turn off the Limit response option
    * Delete the respondentâ€™s answers
  * Not Limited - Allows respondents to answer the survey an unlimited amount of times, and also allow anonymous responses.\

* **Allow Anonymous Responses** Allow users to answer the survey without identifying themselves and without signing in. Please Note: Allow Anonymous Responses is only availble if **Not Limited** is selected under **Limit Responses per Respondent** settings\

* **Confidentiality for Respondents** Enable this setting if you do not want to disclose confidential/personal information about survey respondents to survey administrators.\


Click the **Save** button.

Alternatively, click on the **New** button when in any active survey, add the **Internal Name** and click on the **Save** button.
