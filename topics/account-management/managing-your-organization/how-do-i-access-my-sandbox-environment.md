# How do I access my sandbox environment?

To access your sandbox environment, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Shift iQ website at [www.shiftiq.com](https://www.shiftiq.com/)
2. Scroll to the bottom of the Sign In page.
3. There you'll see an information message that says, "You are signing in to the Production environment."
4. Below this, you'll see links to all other environments available to your organization's account. Typically, this will include Development and Sandbox.
5. Click the link for the environment you want.
6. Copy the URL from your web browser's address bar for future reference.

For example:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/signin-environments.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
