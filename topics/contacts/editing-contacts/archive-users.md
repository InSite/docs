## Archive a User
If a user is no longer needed, or requests to remove their personal information, you are able to archive the user from the system.

If youâ€™d prefer to keep the user records, just change the **First name**, **Last Name** and **Email/Login Name** to something generic like: 
**First Name**: Removed 
**Last Name**: User 
**Email/Login Name**:  removed03112022@email.com
1. On the **Person** tab: disable their email addresses and remove any personal information they may have added, including home addresses and uploaded documents. Optional: Add a comment to their record indicating at whose direction they are being archived. Click **Save**.
2. On the **Memberships** tab, remove them from all group memberships they have. Click **Save**.
3. On the **System Access** tab, **Sign In** sub-tab, uncheck the **System Access** box, any Roles they are still in, and their acceptance of the **Terms and Conditions**. Set their **Archive Status** to Archived. Click **Save**.

You are also able to delete contact records, but this is only recommended for test users that are no longer needed. Prior to deleting these users, we recommend deleting any of the user's records such as Survey responses, Assessment attempts, Invoices, Registrations, Gradebooks, Achievements, etc.; any test data that is also no longer needed. If the contact is deleted without do this, some records will remain but will appear as having been completed by an unknown user.
