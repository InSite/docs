# Review and Edit a Contact

The Person Edit screen is one of the most frequently used screens in Shift iQ. It provides access to all information and activity related to a contact in one place. Whenever a contactâ€™s name appears as a hyperlink, clicking it will take you directly to this screen. Information can be both viewed and updated on this screen.

Under the <i class="fa-user-alt">:user-alt:</i>  **Person** tab:

* **Details**: the key details of a contact record, including name, email, gender, birthday, employment details, phone numbers and more; use the **Send Email** button to send correspondance directly to the contact; use the **More Info** button to access additional details about the contact; use the **History** button to view changes that have been made in the past to the contact record.
* **Other**: additional details about the contact, such as preferred language, time zone, honorific; also any custom fields your organization may be using, and any responses to survey questions with a Respondant Attribute that doesn't match an existing field in the contact record.
* **Documents**: view and manage any attachments uploaded to a contact record, either directly, or through a survey response, workflow case or their jobs candidate portfolio.
* **Addresses**: view and manage home, work, shipping and billing addresses for the contact (note that home address fields can be populated by a survey response using the **Respondant Attribute** fields; the other addresses can be copied from the **Employed By/Belongs To** group on the Details tab, if that Employer group has them).
* **Comments**: add and view comments regarding the contact (only visible to administrators with access to this screen, not visible to contacts with portal access only).

Under the <i class="fa-users">:users:</i>  **Memberships** tab:

* <i class="fa-users">:users:</i>  **Groups**: view and manage all of the groups memberships a contact has, including their membership function and expiry.
* <i class="fa-question">:question:</i>  **Referrals**: view and manage additional details about Employer relationships (contact Support to configure this for your organization).
* <i class="fa-network-wired">:network-wired:</i>  **People**: view and manage hierarchical relationships to Managers, Supervisors and Validators for the contact.

Under the <i class="fa-spell-check">:spell-check:</i>  **Records** tab:

Under the <i class="fa-cogs">:cogs:</i>  **System Access** Tab:

* <i class="fa-user-lock">:user-lock:</i>  **Sign In**: view and manage the contact's access to Shift iQ, such as:
  * grant or revoke access to the system
  * assign a contact to the correct **Role(s)** to ensure they can only access the screens they should (please advise Support when new Administrators are added to admin roles)
  * **reset** a contact's password manually, if required
  * **impersonate** a contact to see what they are seeing (contact Support to configure this for your organization if you don't see the **Impersonate** button on this screen)
  * view and manage a contact's Multi-Factor Authentication settings
  * **archive** a contact record that is no longer active in Shift iQ
* <i class="fa-sign-in-alt">:sign-in-alt:</i>  **Authentications**: view the contact's login history, including which browser they used and from which IP address.
