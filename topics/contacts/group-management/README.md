# Creating and Managing Groups

Users are able to lookup specific groups that were created by going to the **Contacts** Toolkit on the Admin Home Page, and selecting **Groups** under **Counters** panel.

Groups can be looked up using different search **Criteria** like Groups Name, Group Type (Employer, List, Organisation, Role, Venue) or Group Label. The information used to create the group will determine the **Criteria** used to search for a group.

**Settings:** You can also adjust the ‘settings’ and add or modify existing filters for the search criteria section to create a **New Saved Filter**
**Filter:** You can specify one filter for each search operation, but the filter itself can include multiple fields, multiple criteria
**Clear:** The filters should be cleared, as your new search term maybe for something entirely different from the original search query.
