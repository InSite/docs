# Translation Tips

**Translate** the content of each element in the document using the translation feature in the Content panel.

If the headings have been modified in the Set-Up section, they will need to be translated separately. Please send desired translation to InSite support for configuration.

Competencies must be translated directly through the Standards module. Edit the competency you need to translate.
