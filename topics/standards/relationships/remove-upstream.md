# Remove upstream relationships

**Step 1** Edit the downstream Standard you want to remove from itâ€™s parent

**Step 2** In the Details tab, click the X icon to remove the parent relationship.

*Note: If a Standard has more than one parent, removing the relationship this way will only remove the relationship between that Standard and the first parent it had, NOT all parent relationships.*
