# Numbering a Single Standard

Add a numbering system to your Standards for easy reference. The numbers you see in the Standard Outline view are **Codes**.

Example:

In the example below, the Framework **DESIGN** has a code **A**. the GAC asset **Conduct pre-Design Consultations** has a code **1**, and the Competency Asset **Consult with external/internal clien**t has a code **1**. The codes nest automatically so there is no need to enter A.1.1.

To enter a code for a single Standard, edit the standard and enter the code into the Standard/Details/Code box.
