# Competencies in a document print in an illogical structure

The user expects competencies printing in a document to follow the logical structure of the framework, see below.

If the client has not selected some or all lower lowest level competencies from the framework, then the outcome looks illogical.  That is, some mid-level competencies print as lowest level competencies. More than that, Competencies of the same level of the framework can print at different levels in the document, see orange boxes below.

This happens because the order that competencies are printed on the document is relative to the lowest level. If you donâ€™t have any lowest level competencies selected in a section, then the system assumes that the next level up is the lowest level.

This is expected system behaviour.
