From here you can update all the Codes for the Framework you have selected.


*Important: Click the green **Save Changes** button at the bottom of the page, not the **Recode** button at the top of the page. The **Recode** button will re-number all standards in the framework. The **Save Change**s button will save your custom changes.*
