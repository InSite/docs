# Upload Standards using Markdown

When uploading your Competency Framework using Markdown, the structure of the file must follow a specific heading hierarchy, depending on the number of tiers in your framework.

If your framework has 3 levels, just make sure it's structured as **Framework > Area > Competency**, and if your framework has 4 levels then make sure it's structured as **Framework > Area > Competency > Competency. TEST**

To include codes in your competency framework (for easier reference, tracking, or integration), simply add a letter or number in front of each Area or Competency.

Example of Markdown Upload 3 Tiers:\

(_The heading specifying the tiers must be included at the top of your file you are uploading._)
