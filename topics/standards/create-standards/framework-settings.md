# Framework settings and details

To a framework asset’s functional relationships, and/or specific settings and properties for the asset not displayed in Edit Mode, switch to View Mode and select the asset to be edited.
   - Details – Most details will already be completed; some additional ones you may want to use:
      - Code – enter a numbering or alphanumeric coding convention for your framework if it wasn’t entered at creation. Note that you need only define the asset at each tier of the framework and the coding convention will be propogated by the framework asset. 
      - Configuration Properties – These will also likely already be defined from your initial asset creation, but can be added to as appropriate
   - Settings – there are several Settings that can be specified for each Standard asset sub-type that won’t have been done in the hierarchical build of the framework. These include:
      - Complexity/Taxonomy
      - Criticality
      - Frequency
      - Difficulty Level
      - Etc.

   - Categories – allows you to set and assign Categories to assets in order to better organize, 	search and report on them
   - Privacy – allows you to specify what roles or contacts have access to the standard framework.

Notes:
   - Functional relationships typically relate from Plan or Exam assets to frameworks; these will be considered in the following workshops.
   - Some of the Builder tools are not needed when working with Framework assets; e.g., the Pin tool is used primarily with Exam Builder.
   - As you are building the framework, refer to the two-pane work panel frequently. The left pane or View Mode will now be displaying the competency framework and its elements hierarchically. 

   - This should now mimic your reference competency framework document, but will have asset numbers and properties assigned to each of the elements within the framework. The right frame or *Asset Creation* pane allows you to refer to the properties of the individual asset within the framework you are creating.
   - After completing the framework, check it against your original reference document to be sure it has been captured correctly.
   - Publish the competency framework by saving it in the Shift iQ environment so that you can display and use it. It will now be listed as a published asset in the Frameworks app.
   - Note that if you create the skills development plan related to this framework that you will be referencing it frequently.
