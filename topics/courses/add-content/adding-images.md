# Adding Images

You are able to drag and drop a picture from file into the body of the content.\
\
Accounts are configured with a file size limit of 1MB per image. If the file size is bigger than 1MB, please decrease the size of your file before uploading it, or contact your administrator to upgrade the settings for your account.\
\
The recommended maximum size for an upload image is 800x800 pixels. If a size of your image is bigger 800x800 pixels, the system will automatically scale the image for you. You might want to resize your own images before you upload them.\
\
When you added the picture to the content, it will display in a URL format:\
e.g. !\[agriculture-1.jpg]\(https://e02.insite.com/files/sites/global/adding-images-or-videos/agriculture-1.jpg)

In the Course you will be able to see the picture you uploaded.
