Once you have made the required updats, click the **Save** button.

Under the **Activity Setup** tab you can set your **Prerequisite** for the lesson. If a prerequisite is set, learners must satisfy these prerequisites before the activity is available to start in the course.

Select a **Requirement** that learners must satisfy before the activity is considered complete.

**Activity Type** lists the different lesson types you can have in a course. You can select a different lesson type by selecting the field next to the type name.

	* For a speed typing test, the question could be about typing a sentence or a set of characters as quickly and accurately as possible, with the test measuring typing speed or accuracy.
	* For a data capturing test, the question could involve entering specific information (like text, numbers, or selections) from a given dataset, testing the learner's ability to accurately capture or transcribe data.

In the **Activity Name** field, you can update or rename the lesson.

You have the option to make lessons adaptive by selecting **Adaptive** under **Activity Settings**. When **Adaptive** is selected, the lesson will be hidden in the course until the lesson is unlocked..
