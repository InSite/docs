There are 2 ways to Publish a course to the portal:
1. From the Course itself;
2. From the Sites toolkit.

**1. Publish a Course to the Portal, from the Course:**
* In the Course, click on the **Course Setup** tab, then the **Publication** tab.
* Select the Site URL in the **Web Portal** field (organization.insite.com / organization.shiftiq.com).
* Select the **Web Folder** (page) where you want to publish the course to.
* Click on the plus icon (<i class="fas fa-plus-circle"></i>) next to the **Web Page** field. This will generate the URl (Course Slug (URL Segment)) for the Course.
* The **Web Page Status** field will appear with a **Published** checkbox. This box will be selected by default and the Course will be Published. If you wish to Unpublish the Course, unselect teh checkbox.
* Click the **Save** button.

**2. Publish a Course from the Sites toolkit:**
Courses remain visible to administrators only, unless they are **published** to the Portal.  The Portal is where your users will access your **Courses**.

* In a new browser tab, open the **Sites** toolkit. Navigate to the page where you would like to add the course to.
* Under the **Page Setup** tab, click on the **Settings** tab. Click on the Pencil icon next to the **Layout (Content Control)** field.
* Below the **Update Content** heading,  select Course from the dropdown menu below **Layout (Content Control)**, then select the **Course** you want to publish on the portal from the dropdown menu.
* Click **Save**
* The course will be **published** on the portal for users to complete.
