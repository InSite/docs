To embed a video on a Course, you will need to upload the video to either **Vimeo** or **You Tube**.

After video is uploaded, select **Share**, this will give you an **Embed** link.

Copy and past the link into the body of the course content to add the video and click **Save**

If you do not have a **Vimeo** or **You Tube** account to upload the video, we can provide this service. Once uploaded, we will share the Embed link with you; please email [support@shiftiq.com](mailto:support@shiftiq.com).
