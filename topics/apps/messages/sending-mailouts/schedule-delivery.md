In the Notification, Newsleter or Invitation, click on the **Message Setup** tabl and click the **Schedule Mailout** to schedule the mailout. 

Select the **Date and Time** you want your **Invitation/Newsletter/Notification** to be sent out.

Click the **Add to Schedule** button.

Pending messages are sent every fifteen minutes, so if you schedule this mailout now then you might still need to wait several minutes before delivery is complete. 

Limit the number of recipients to 10,000. Mailouts larger than this tend to trigger spam filters. To help prevent this, Messages are released from the system in batches to lower the chance of being flagged by a spam filter. Large mailouts may be released over several hours. If you need to send to more than 10,000 recipients, consider sending in multiple batches.
