You can attach multiple mailing lists to one message. The group members are copied into the recipient list of the message; If you add/remove individuals from a mailing list they will NOT be added/removed from the message.

Click on the **Subscribers/Recipients** tab to add **Subscribers/Recipients** to your message

Then click on the **Add Subscriber** button.

You can add **Subscribers** one at a time, or you can add a whole Group. Groups do not have to be a 
Mailing List to be added to a Message; Groups of any Type can be added. For example, if you have a pre-defined 
list of Companies that you want to send it to, just add it to the message. All contacts on that list will be 
included. 

**Adding a Group:**

* In the **Search** card select **Group** in the **Contact Type** field.
* In the **Group Type** field select the type of group being added as the **Subscribers/Recipients** (Department, District, Employer, List, Role, Team, Venue)
* Click the **Search** button
* In the **Groups** card, select the groups you want to add as the **Subscribers/Recipients** and click the **Add** button.

**Adding Individuals:**

* In the **Search** card select **Person** in the **Contact Type** field.
* Search for the individuals you want to add using the **Name** and **Email** fields. 
* In the **Code(s)** field, you can search for users using their Person Code. 
* After adding the details, click the **Search** button
* Select the **People** card, select the individuals you want to add as the **Subscribers/Recipients** and click the **Add** button.

You can re-use newsletters (Messages) over and over by removing the last batch of recipients and adding new ones.
