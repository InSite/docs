Publish Documents to the Portal through the Web Sites module. We recommend you make a Folder to group your Documents on the portal. 

Note that you must have the admin/standards/documents permission in order to modify relationships for documents in the portal. If you are unable to modify relationships, please contact your administrator to have this permission added to your account.

Create one Page inside your Folder for each Document or Analysis tool you want to appear on the Portal. Create an external link from the page to the document using the following syntax:
*/ui/portal/standards/documents/search?type=Job+Description*
Note that the name of the tile on the portal does not have to be the same as the name of the Document. For example, you could use the above link to publish your job descriptions, but name the tile Customized Job Descriptions.

Allow users to search for all documents with the following syntax:
*/ui/portal/standards/documents/search*

Control access to Documents on the portal using the Privacy settings on the Web Site Page.  On the Privacy tab of the Page panel,  set which group you would like to access each document.

Note that you must have the admin/standards/documents permission in order to modify relationships for documents in the portal. If you are unable to modify relationships, please contact your administrator to have this permission added to your account.
