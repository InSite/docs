Documents are created to group and print Standards into various useful outputs

Create a new Document using the Administration Tools panel in the Standards Module.  All Documents consist of four parts.

**Set-Up**
Title and additional information you would like to include with your document. The additional information fields available depend on which document you are working with.  For example, a Job Description document contains places to enter Location, Purpose, Responsibilities, etc.

Use your document as a Template by checking the Template checkbox under the Settings tab. Template documents are locked on the portal.  They may be duplicated, but not modified.

**Attach Competencies**
Attach Competencies to your document on the Competencies panel. You may include some or all competencies in a particulare area.  If you choose to attach only some, the parent area for those competencies will still print on the Document as a header. In order for competencies to show on the outline screen, you must follow the convention: FRAMEWORK, then Area Asset, then Competency.

**Relate other Documents**
Attach a pre-selected group of competencies by relating an existing Document.  All the competencies from the related document will now be attached to the current document.

**Download**
Output and print a copy of your document using hte Download button in the Setup section.

**FAQ**
**Why can't I relate a NOS or Job Description to one I'm creating?**

In order to relate a document 2 conditions must be met:
* The Document you are editing must not be a template (Settings tab)
* You must have been assigned permission to the Standards/Documents module. If you do not have this permission, please contact your administrator.
