A good process (or best practice) for building a complex, hierarchical framework in Shift iQ with the Framework Builder tool is to:
1. Create the framework and its properties
2. Create the Level 1 competencies and organizers
3. Create the Level 2 competencies and organizers 
4. Create further levels for each of the Level 1 competencies

Note that if the Framework asset youâ€™re creating is to be evaluated by assessments (i.e, an exam form, exam specification), it is typically best to follow the tiers of:
   - Framework
      - General Area of Competence (GAC)
         - Competency
            - Task
