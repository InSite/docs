Occupations are just a type of Framework Standard.

**Step 1** Create an Occupations Standard

**Step 2** Add the Occupations you want

**Step 3** Open the Occupation you want to work on and create Containment relationships between that occupation and the Competencies or Standards that satisfy that Occupation.

*Note: Multiple Occupations can map to the same Standard. E.G. you may want to configure your data so
that EVERY Occupation contains the “Maintains Safe Work Environment” Standard.*
