From the Admin Home page select the **Standards** Toolkit

Under the **Counters** panel, select the **Standard Type** you would like to search for

Users are able to search for a specific **Standard Type: Area, Competency, Document, Framework or Profile**
You can view as little or as much information as you want on the **Standards Search** page by selecting the information you require to see under **Settings**.

**Filter:** You can specify one filter for each search operation, but the filter itself can include multiple fields, multiple criteria
**Clear:** The filters should be cleared, as your new search term maybe for something entirely different from the original search query.
