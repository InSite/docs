### System-Generated Exam Passwords

An **Exam Specific Password** is generated for a Learner at the time they complete their Class registration. The password appears to a system administartor, below the learner's registration Status, under the Status column in the Class.

The password is editable by a system administrator, by clicking the Pencil icon (<i class="fas fa-pencil"></i>) next to the learner's registration. In the Registration card, you can update the password in the Exam Password field. Click the Save button after making any changes to the password. The new password will update and be displayed under the regisrtation Status of the learner.

### Providing Exam Login details to a Learner

To login to an exam, learners require the following information:
* **Learner ID (Person Code)**
	* The **Learner ID (Person Code)** is in the learner's **Contact Record** and should be added to the learner's Contact Record either prior or during the registration. It can be added after registration, but if added after it will not be included in the **RegistrationCompleted** alert (see below). 
		* A **Learner ID (Person Code)** can also be **automatically** generated at the time a **New** Contact Record is created. Ask your Shift iQ Account Representative for further information.
* **Exam Event Password**
	* The **Exam Event Password** is generated at the time of registration.

The **Learner ID** and **Exam Event Password** can be provided to learners in 2 ways:

1. After the learner completes their class registration, they receive the **RegistrationCompleted** alert with their registration details. We can add the **Exam Login** details to the **RegistrationCompleted** alert, so the learner will have their exam login details. 
	* The learner will **only** be able to login to their exam using the **Events Login** page, which will be provded to the learner by the Instructor/Assessor/Invigilator at the time they are taking their exam. This password will not allow them to login using the **Portal Sign In** page.
	* Learners do **not** require previous **Access Granted** to Shift iQ to login for an exam, as long as they have a contact record in Shift iQ and is registered for a class.
2. The exam login details can be provided to the learners by the Instructor/Assessor/Invigilator at the time they are taking their exam.
