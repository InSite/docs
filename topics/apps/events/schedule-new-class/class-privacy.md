**Groups** in the Contacts toolkit can be used to set access permissions for the **Classes** published on the **Portal**. If no Groups have been created or new groups are required, it can be added in the Contacts toolkit, using Groups (See <a href="/ui/help/apps/portal/contacts/group-management/adding-new-group" target="_blank">**Create a New Group**</a>). 

Under the Privacy tab click on the Pencil Icon (<i class="fas fa-pencil-alt"></i>)  next to the Groups field.

In the **Filter** card, select the **Group Type** (**Department**, **District**, **Employer**, **List**, **Role**, **Team**, **Venue**) and then in the **Update Groups** card select the groups that are allowed to the see the Class on the Portal.

Click the **Save** button to save your changes.

*Note: You are able to give permissions to different Group Types for the same Folder/Page.
e.g. A combination of Groups withing a Role and within a List can be added to the permission list of a Foler/Page.*
