* by achievement title, status and/or tag, learner name, learner employer (and employer group status and region) and dates acheivement was granted, revoked or expired
* credentials.xls report - maybe need to get query language for this from Aleksey and move this to RCABC's queries, not sure it makes sense for other customers not using trades and employers

outline:
* shows information about the achievement template configuration, and about the user who was granted the acheivmement [should we get rid of the CMDS refs outside of partition 3?]
* authority [what is this, or what is the plan for this, is it to do with blockchain maybe?]
* shows information about the credential, when it was granted, expired, etc.

edit options:
* configure - set or edit a fixed or relative expiry date, add a necessity and a priority (contact support to configure a collection to use either of these fields) [who uses these and what for?]
* grant - change the granted date
* revoke - revoke the credential and give a reason for the revocation [who uses this and what for?]

delete the achievement - if it was granted in error
