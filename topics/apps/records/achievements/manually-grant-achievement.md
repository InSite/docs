In most cases, Achievements will be automatically granted to a learner based on a Course or Gradebook result. However, there may be times when it is necessary to manually grant an Achievement to an individual learner. Here is how you do so:

1. Select **Records** Toolkit, **Achievement Template** counter. 
1. Search for and open the **Achievement** you want to grant to a learner by clicking on the Title or edit pencil on the **Achievement Search** page. 
1. On the **Achievements** tab, click the **Grant Certificate** button.
1. Search for the learner by **Name** or **Email**, and click **Search**.
1. Select the checkbox next to the learner's name and click the **Next** button.
1. Select the Assigned date for the Achievement and under the Status heading select **Assigned and Granted**.  Select the **date and time** the Achievement was granted and click **Save**.
