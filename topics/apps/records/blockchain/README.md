Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. All of these qualities make blockchain the best candidate for safe and permanent record keeping. Additionally, cryptographic concepts that form the underlying structure of Blockchain, such as digital signatures, can be utilized for other means as well.
