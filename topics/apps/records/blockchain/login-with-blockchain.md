Another interesting integration of Shift iQ with Blockchain technology can be found on the login page, this functionality provides our users with the benefit of logging in to their accounts using a digital signature associated with their Ethereum wallet. In order to use this functionality, users need to connect their  Ethereum wallet with Shift iQ through the [steps mentioned](https://e02.insite.com/portals/portal/records/blockchain/blockchain-wallet). Users can then use the **Login with MetaMask** button on the login page when logging in to Shift iQ; they just need to sign a nonce every time to prove their identity. No password or username is required.
