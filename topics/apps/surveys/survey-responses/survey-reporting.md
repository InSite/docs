Once your survey has responses, you can review the aggregate results in Survey Reports. Access the Survey **Report** on the **Survey Results** search screen (graph icon at the end of each line in the results) or when looking at the survey itself by clicking on the **Reports** button. 

### Analyzing Responses (Frequency Distribution Analysis panel)
When you open the report, it first diplays the **Frequency Distribution Analysis** panel, which contains a visual representation for the distribution of all completed answers within the survey, even if a respondent didn't finish and submit their response. Click on the **Print** button here if you want to print the distribution analysis of the answers. This will open the visual representation in a new tab (you may need to **allow** popups and redirects for our site on your browser for this new tab to open). To get a print out or print to pdf of this distribution analysis, right click anywhere on the page and follow your browser's options. Note that Mean and Standard Deviation will only show for questions that have been configured with a scoring scale. Likert Questions are a good example of this.

You can also filter your respones in a variety of ways using options in the **Reports** panel, above the **Frequency Distribution Analysis** panel. Options include:
- Filtering by quantitative (aggregated responses, relative % of total, histogram) or qualitative (text answers, comments) response types.
- Filtering by individual survey questions. Stack filters for more targeted reporting.
- Filtering by submission date range.
- Filtering by a specific group of respondants.

### Report Panel
In addition to filtering criteria for the **Frequency Distribution Analysis** results, the following options are available in the Report panel:

**Correlation Analysis**
Shift iQ allows you to manipulate your data to identify the strength of a relationship between two variables. Set data across the x and y axis to view correlations between answer fields.
1. Open up the **Correlation Analysis** tab of the **Report** panel to configure the report you'd like to view
1. Choose a question to represent the X-axis. The title field will appear as your X-axis label. Click the **Add Variable** button.
1. Choose a question to represent the X-axis. The title field will appear as your X-axis label. Click the **Add Variable** button.
1. Click **Submit** to view your report. The results will appear in a **Correlation Analysis** panel below the **Report** panel and the **Frequency Distribution Analysis** panel will be hidden until **Submit** is clicked on the **Frequency Distribution Analysis** tab.

**Download Results**
On the **Download Report** tab, you can download a zip file containing .csv spreadsheet files for the entire survey; including Answers, Choices, Questions, Respondents and the Survey Data Set, (if you opt for the additional Meta Data files). The Default settings (recommended) on this panel are best if you just need to analyze your data in a spreadsheet. If you need to do analysis or comparison on survey results (pivot tables, for example) you may want to encode answer options as numbers. UTF-8 text encoding is generally suitable for most surveys; Unicode is recommended if your survey has other languages with Cyrillic characters, for example.


### Time Series Analysis Panel
Time Series Analysis enables an admin to view survey response activity over time.

### Survey Invitation Analytics Panel
This panel shows the response rate of survey invitations that have been sent out via the **Messages** toolkit to unique users. It doesn't show results if a survey is shared via a generic link rather than an invitation. Clicking on any of the hyperlinked numbers on this panel will download a report of the respondents or deliveries in question. 

### Submitted Responses Panel
View individual survey responses on the Submitted Responses panel, using the magnifying glass at the end of each line. Note the lock icon; when a response has been completed (submitted or confirmed) they will show as locked, and partially completed responses will show as unlocked. Admins can unlock a locked response and vise versa by clicking this icon; respondents can edit/continue an unlocked response but can only review their submission to locked respones. When a survey is unlocked, the survey respondent will be able to resume the survey and re-submit it later.
