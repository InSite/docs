* Click on the **Add New Invitation** link at the top of the page.
* Add information into the following fields:
	* **Survey Form** - A link to this survey must be included in the body of the invitation email.
	* Add the **Internal Name** and **Subject**.
* Under the **Content** tab, add the** Content** you want included in your **Invitiation**. This will be the body of the message the respondent receives via email.  
* Add Subscribers/Recipients

Even if you have multiple recipients, you can choose to send to only one using the paper airplane icon on the Subscribers/Recipients panel.

### Removing recipients from a Survey Invitation

View and edit survey subscribers/respondents through the Messages toolkit, not through the Surveys toolkit.

* Open the **Messages** Toolkit and search for the **Invitation** you need to remove recipients (Subscribers) for.
* Under the **Subscriber** tab and click on the Trash Can icon (<i class="fas fa-trash-alt"></i>) next to the subscribers name.
* Confirm you want to remove the subscriber by clicking on the** Delete** button.

**Note:** When a survey invitation is sent, it will exclude the recipients who have already answered the survey.

### Send a reminder by scheduling a mailout

You can use a survey invitation to send reminders by scheduling a mailout. Reminders are only sent to people who have not yet completed a response to the survey. People on the Subscriber list are excluded if they have completed the survey. Prior to scheduling a reminder mailout, we recommend that you edit the subject and contents of the invitation to indicate that it is a reminder, not a new invitation.
