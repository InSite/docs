Click on the **Questions** tab and then the **Add question** button to start adding questions to the survey. 

There are different question types that can be added to a survey:

**Quantitative question types**
- **Radio Button List** (single select): questions restrict respondents to a single answer
- **Dropdown Lis**t (single select): questions restrict respondents to a single answer, but use less physical space on the page
- **Check Box List** (multi-select): You cannot use the Answer Required checkbox (currently the Answer Required feature requires (or does not require) answers to all the answer fields in the question. With a multi-select question type, a user can answer some, but not all, which makes this invalid.) You cannot calculate statistics on a check box question type

**Qualitative question types**
- **Comment Box**
- **Date Selector**
- **Number Box**
- **File Upload**

**Special input controls**
- **Break Question:** insert a question on the survey with no answer options.  This is often used to create section headings or provide the respondent with necessary information inline.
- **Break Page:** Inserts a page break into the list of questions
- **Terminate Survey**: triggers the end of the survey. Surveys do not display text written in a terminate survey question box.  To enter text to terminate a survey, the user must first put a break question with desired text then an empty Terminate Survey question.

**Points**
For quantitative question types, points are usually assigned as 0 for incorrect responses, and 1 for correct responses. Likert question types are more likely to use a scale for rating the answers.

**Category**
Categories are used for the purpose of summarizing or grouping output for reports.
