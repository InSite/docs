To embed a video on the portal, you will need to upload the video to either **Vimeo** or **You Tube**.

When you select **Share**, it will give you an **Embed** link.

Copy and past the link into the body of the site content to add the video and click **Save**

If you do not have a **Vimeo** or **You Tube** account to upload the video, **InSite** can upload your video to our **Vimeo** account. Once uploaded, we will share the Embed link with you so you are able to add the video.
