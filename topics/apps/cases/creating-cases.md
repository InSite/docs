### Create an Case using Surveys:

Administrators are able to allow users to create their own **Case** by submitting a Survey reponse. 

In the **Surveys** toolkit, open the survey you want to use to create an **Case**.

Under the **Configuration** heading, in the **Details** tab, click on the pencil icon (<i class="fas fa-pencil-alt"></i>) next to **Case Workflow**.

Click in the **Open a new case when a response to this survey is completed** checkbox under the **Case Workflow** heading.

Each **Survey Response** that is submitted by a user will create an **Case**, so an Administrator can select what type of **Case** should be created and who it needs to be assigned to. The following fields must be completed:
* **Case Type** - The **Case Type** need to be setup by **Shift iQ Support**, please email [**support@shiftiq.com**](mailto:support@shiftiq.com) to add your Case Types.
* **Case Status** - The current status of the Case. The status options need to be setup by **Shift iQ Support**, please email [**support@shiftiq.com**](mailto:support@shiftiq.com) to add your **Issue Status** options.
* **Case Administrator** - Internal office staff/administrator who is responsible for managing the Case
* **Current Owner** - The person to whom responsibility is currently assigned.

Click **Save**.

When a **Survey Response** is used to create an case, that response will be attached to the **Case** and can be viewed from the **Case**.

A **Response Completed** notification can be added to the survey to advise an administrator when a response was submitted.
