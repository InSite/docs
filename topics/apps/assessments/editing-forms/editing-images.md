There are two easy ways to add an image to an assessment question:

**1. Drag and Drop the Image**

While creating or editing an assessment question, you can simply drag the image from your computer and drop it directly into the content field. It’s a quick and convenient way to add images without needing to navigate away from the page.

**2. Upload Image to the Assessment Bank**

Alternatively, you can upload the image to the Assessment Bank first. Once uploaded, you can easily select the image from the bank and attach it to the specific question. This method helps keep all your images organized in one place and provides you with additional management options, like tracking usage and image versions.

*Note:  The maximum size of an image that can be uploaded is 1 MB. If you require a bigger image to be uploaded, please contact your Shift iQ account representative.*

**How to Upload an Image to the Assessment Bank**
* In the Assessment Bank, click on the Attachments tab, then click the Add Attachment button.
* Next to the File field, click on the magnifying glass icon and select the image you want to upload.
* Options for the Image:
	* Title: You can edit the title of the image. This title will be visible to the user if they click on the image during their assessment attempt.
	* Condition: Choose from the following options:
		* Duplicate: If the image is a copy of an existing one.
		* Edit: If the image is a version that has been edited.
		* New: If the image is newly uploaded.
		* Purge: If the image is no longer needed and should be removed.
		* Surplus: If the image is extra or not in active use.
		* Unassigned: If the image hasn’t been assigned to any specific content yet.
		* Actual Dimensions: This shows the original size of the image.
	* Target Online Dimensions: Here, you can specify the size at which the image should display to the learner online.
	* Target Paper Dimensions: If you’re printing the assessment form for an exam, set the image size for its appearance in the printed version.
	* Palette: Specify the color scheme of the image (e.g., Color, Black and White).

This process helps ensure that the image is uploaded properly and formatted for different viewing scenarios.

**Editing or Changing an Uploaded Image**
* Under the Attachments tab, click on the edit pencil icon next to the image's Asset number.
* You can edit the following details:
	* Title
	* Condition
	* Target Online Dimensions
	* Target Paper Dimensions
	* Palette
* if the incorrect image was uploaded, you can replace it by clicking on the magnifying glass icon next to the Replace with File field and selecting the correct image. Keep in mind that replacing the image will remove the original image that was uploaded.
* Alternatively, you can create a new version of the image without losing the original by clicking the Arrow icon <i class="fas fa-arrow-alt-up"></i> under the **Current Version** heading and then uploading the new image. This way, the original image will remain intact, and the new version will be added to the image history.

**Deleting an Image**

If the incorrect image was uploaded, you can delete it by clicking on the trash can icon next to the image's Asset number. After clicking the icon, you will be redirected to the Delete Confirmation page, where you will need to confirm if you want to proceed with the deletion. If there are multiple versions of the image, you will be prompted to choose whether you want to delete just the current version or all versions of the image.

<span style="color:red">Please Note: Deleting an image is a permanent change that cannot be undone. The image will be deleted from all forms, queries, and reports.</span>

**View the Image History**

Any changes made to an image by an administrator are recorded in the system. To view the history of an image, click on the History icon <i class="far fa-history"></i> below the image. This will display a record of who made changes and what changes were made. 

**Image Usage Report**

Each image you upload into the system keeps a record of where it’s being used. Specifically, it tracks which questions the image appears in and the date when it was added. This allows you to easily see how and when the image is being utilized across assessments, helping you stay organized and keep track of your content efficiently.

**Scan Images** 

The **Scan Images** button is designed to help manage and organize images associated with questions in a question bank. After migrating questions from an one bank to another, the image links associated with the questions might still point to the old bank, which can cause issues if those links are broken or if you need to update the images independently.

When clicking the **Scan Images** button:
* You can quickly find any questions with image links that are still referencing the old bank.
	* If the image **exists** as an attachment in the new bank, it gets a **green checkmark** (<i class="far fa-check-circle"></i>).
	* If the image **doesn’t exist** as an attachment, it gets a **red exclamation** (<i class="far fa-exclamation-circle"></i>).
* Convert the image links to Attachments by clicking on the **Add Attachments** icon (<i class="fas fa-plus-circle"></i>). The images will be copied or migrated into the new Bank as an Assessment Attachment.
* You will then be able to modify, update, or manage the images without impacting the old bank or its assets.
