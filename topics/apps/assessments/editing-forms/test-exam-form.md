After an Form was created for an exam, an Administrator can test the Form by **Publishing** or **Pre-Publishing** the Form. 

#### Publish the Form:

Publish the Form as a **Standalone** Form, with permissions so only the Administrator can see the From on the Portal. (See [How to publish an exam Form](/ui/help/apps/portal/assessments/editing-forms/publish-exam-form))

From the portal start the exam and review the following to ensure they are as desired.

**On the Start Page:**
* Instructions;
* Time limit for the exam

**When attempt is started**
* The **Learner Feedback** icon (<i class="fas fa-comment"></i>) and functionality, if selected. If so, ensure question feedback is working by posting a comment, and using Review Feedback to check.
* Check **Bookmark** functionality (<i class="far fa-bookmark"></i>).
* Exam countdown **Timer** (If enabled).

**Complete and submit your attempt to review:**
* Scores are disclosed as desired. 
* Additional attempts for the exam are available as desired.
* If Assessment Attempt is locked after the allocated time has run out.

#### Pre-Publish the Form:

An Administrator can Pre-Publish an Assessment Form for **testing** purposes. You will be able to complete the Assessment Form and submit your attempt.

* In the **Question Bank**, select the **Forms** tab.
* If you have multiple Assessment Forms for the same Assessment Bank, select the From you want to Pre-Publish from the dropdown list at the top of the Form page.
* Click on **Action** button and select **Prepublish**.
* On the **Pre-Publish** page, you will see a URL on the right side, under the **Start an exam attempt** heading. Click on this URL to start your attempt.
	* This Pre-Publish URL is intended for use by administrators only, to review and test the Assessment Form. It should NOT be shared with actual Assessment takers. To publish an Assessment FROM for non-admin testing, please see [**How to publish an exam Form**](/ui/help/apps/portal/assessments/editing-forms/publish-exam-form).


###### Important Notes:
* <span style="color:red">The Pre-Publish URL is for **Administrator Access Only**. This link is strictly for administrative testing and review of the assessment form. Distribution to, or use by, actual assessment takers is NOT advised. Any assessment attempts completed using this link are considered to be tests and are NOT recorded by the system.</span>

* The system does not keep attempts for Forms that has an **Publication Status = Drafted**. If an attempt is submitted, while the form has an **Publication Status = Drafted**, the last thing the learner's session does is clean up after itself by deleting the attempt. There will be no record of the Pre-Published attempt. If you want to have a record of a Published attempt, then you should publish the Assessment Form as a Standalone Assessment on the Portal.
