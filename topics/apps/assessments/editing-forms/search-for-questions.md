Admins can perform advanced searches in the **Questions** tab by using advanced search syntax. 
(The syntax here follows the same convention that Google uses for its advanced search.)

Under the **Question** tab, in the filter field at the top of the page, add the **parameter:value** and click the filter button. 
The results will bring up all questions in the bank with the enetered **parameter:value**.

If "**parameter**" is not included in the filter field, then the **Parameter="keyword"** is assumed.
