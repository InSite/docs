When **Sections as Tabs** is enabled and **Tab Navigation** is disabled, you can set timers for individual sections (tabs) within the assessment form. This allows you to control the time learners can spend on different parts of the assessment. 

There are the two options available for configuring timers:

1. **Enable Timer for Some Tabs** 
	This option allows you to set a timer for specific tabs within the assessment form. Itâ€™s useful if you want to give learners a break in between sections, such as during an extended exam where you allow them time to rest or stretch their legs. If this option is selected, the **Break Timer** should only be enabled for the specific tabs where you want to add a timer (e.g., between sections). This could be a short break to allow learners to relax before continuing the assessment.
		
2. **Enable Timer for All Tabs** 
	When you enable the Tab Time Limit for all tabs, you will need to specify a time limit for each individual tab within the form. This ensures that each section has a defined time duration, and learners must complete each section within the specified time frame. For example, if your assessment has 4 sections and you want learners to spend 15 minutes on each section, you would set a 15-minute time limit for each tab. The system will automatically calculate the total time allowed to complete the entire assessment based on the time limits set for each tab. For instance, if you set a 15-minute time limit for each of four sections, the total time allowed for the whole assessment will be 60 minutes. When timers are enabled for all tabs, the Break Timer will automatically be available for each tab.
