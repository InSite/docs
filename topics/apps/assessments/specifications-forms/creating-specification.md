**Static Specifications can be used to generate exam Forms. This allows administrators to specific which questions should be on the Assessment Form.**

- Select **Add** under the Specifications panel.
- Choose **Static** as the **Specification Type** 
     - Specification Types:
         - Static (Fixed identically for all attempts): A form with this specification has a fixed set of questions in a fixed sequence, which is determined by the author of the form. Every learner who starts an attempt on form with a Static specification sees exactly the same set of questions in exactly the same sequence.
         - Dynamic ( Generated randomly per attempt): A form with this specification does not have a fixed set of questions. If two learners start an attempt on this type of form, then each learner may be presented with a different set of questions and/or questions in a different sequence.
- Create a **Specification Name**
- Select an optional **Consequence Type** (high, medium, low). Indicates the stakes for exam forms following this specification.
- Enter an **From Limit** on the maximum number of forms that can be generated based on this specification.
- Enter an **Question Item Limit** on the maximum number of questions allowed on each exam.
- Select the Disclosure Type (None, Partial, Full). This selection affects the information learners receive about their performance on the exam when itâ€™s submitted. Full is best practice for exams with multiple forms and randomized questions. For non-randomized exams; not a good idea for full disclosure, use partial.
- Enter a **Passing Score (%)**, the minimum score required to pass the exam.
- Enter an **Weight on Success (%)** - If the student/candidate passes the exam, what weight is applied to the submission score?
- Enter an **Weight on Failure (%)** - If the student/candidate fails the exam, what weight is applied to the submission score?
- Select one or more **Question Sets** you would like to include.
