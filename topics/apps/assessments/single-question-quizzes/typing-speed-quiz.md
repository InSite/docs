The Typing Speed quiz is an assessment designed to measure how fast and accurately someone can type. The test typically involves typing a set of words or a passage of text within a specific time frame (usually measured in seconds or minutes). 
The goal is to assess the user's words per minute (WPM) rate and their accuracy.
