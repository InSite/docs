From the Admin Home Page, select **Contacts** toolkit.

In the **Counters** panel, click on **People** counter. 

Click on **Add New Person** link to create/add a new contact (Top of the page).

Provide Basic Details for the new contact person. 
The following fields are **Required Fields:**
* First Name
* Last Name
* Email 

Select the checkbox next to **User Access Granted** to grant access to the user you are adding. An **Temporary Password** will automatically be generated for the user to use for their first login. A user will be required to change this password the first time they sign in.

Select the permission list to which you want to assign this new user account.

Click **Save** to save the new contact.

Once a new user has been added, an **Welcome Email** will automatically be sent to the user with their **Login Name** and **Temporary Password**.  The user will be required to update their password when they login for the first time. 

If the user does not receive the **Welome Email**, you can resend the **Welcome Email** to the user by searching for the user (see [**Searching Contacts**](/ui/help/apps/portal/contacts/editing-contacts/searching-contacts)) and click on **System Access** tab. Click on the **Send Email** button and select Welcome. On the Send Email screen, select the Shift iQ Alerts (Mailgun) sender and review the information in the content field. You are able to make changes to the content if needed, then click the **Next** button. You will be redirected to the Confirm screen to review the message that will be sent to the user. Click **Confirm** to send the message.

##### ***Please Note:**  If the contact record was created **72 hours** prior to sending the **Welcome Email**, you would need to do a **[Password Reset](/ui/help/apps/portal/contacts/editing-contacts/password-resets)** before sending the **Welcome Email**.*
