The **Contacts** tool kit is where you can create and edit all the contacts and groups that exist for your organization. Contacts can be Users (your customers), who only have access to a portal, or Administrators (your coworkers), who have access to create and edit content for your Users. Permissions are also controlled here, using Group membership. Contacts can have Membership in multiple Groups; allowing for intricate relationship management and reporting.
