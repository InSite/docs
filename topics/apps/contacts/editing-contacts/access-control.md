Find the User you want to add/remove/review Access Control or Role Settings (see [**Searching Contacts**](/ui/help/apps/portal/contacts/searching-contacts)).

Click on the **System Access** tab and then under the **Sign In** tab you can review the **User Credentials**, **Access Control** and **Roles** assigned to a user.

**Credentials:**

**Password Expiry:** We HIGHLY recommend that you set user’s passwords to expire every 6 months at a maximum. If a user’s password expires, they will be required to enter a new password the next time they log in.
**Licensed:** The Licensed checkbox shows whether or not the user has agreed to the terms and conditions of use (pop-up box that appears with first login)

**Impersonate the User:**
1. Login under an admin account, search for the user you would like to impersonate.   
2. Click on the **System Access** tab and then under the **Sign In** tab you can click on the **Impersonate User** button.
3. The session will be automatically routed to being logged in as that user whom you would like to impersonate.
4. Once you’re done checking for functionality and access of the user, you have to **Stop Impersonating** the user, by clicking on your name in the Menu bar.

**Reset Password:**
1. Login under an admin account, search for the user that is requesting a password reset.   
2. Click on the **System Access** tab and then under the **Sign In** tab click on the **Reset Password** button.
3. This will autogenerate the password and its confirmation. **Save** the Password and communicate the new password to the user.

**Access Control:**

**Access Granted:** The Approved checkbox turns that person’s account on 

**Two Step authentication:**

Two-step verification is a process that involves two authentication methods performed one after the other to verify that someone or something requesting access is who or what they are declared to be.
1. **Optional:**  Allow user to choose between enabling, disabling multi-factor authentication.
2. **Mandatory:**  Forces user to activate multi-factor authentication upon next successful login.
3. **Current MFA Mode:** Displays the current MFA selected.

**Roles:**

Every Organization is responsible for ‘cataloging users’ within a system so that everyone who has access to it can be properly authenticated

*It is important for better access control that the roles of identities are clear and allow easy identification of the individual who wants to access them.*
