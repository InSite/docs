<span style="color:red">**Deleting a Contact Record:** Deleting contact records should be used with **caution**. Deleting a contact will remove the link to all of their activitity in the system and is typically only done with duplicate records that have never logged in. If it is someone who has had activity but left your organization, it is better to Archive the user and remove their access to the system using the Sign In tab.</span>

#### Phone Number Auto-Configuration parameters

When an telephone number is added to a users Contact Record, Shift iQ automatically configurates the phone number based on the number of digits added: 

* If you save the record with **10 digits** in any of the phone fields, our system adds brackets around the first 3 digits, adds a space after the second bracket and adds a dash before the last four digits. 
**Example:**  1234567890

* If you put **11 digits** and save, it removes whatever the first digit is, adds brackets around the first 3 digits, adds a space after the second bracket and adds a dash before the last four digits. 
**Example:** 12345678901

* If you put **periods** or **dashes** in between **10 or 11 digits**, our system removes those dots or dashes, adds brackets around the first 3 digits, adds a space after the second bracket and adds a dash before the last four digits. 
**Example:** 123-456-7890 / 1234-567-8901
![phone-number-1.png](https://e02.insite.com/files/web/a53ae6fb-9834-4fd4-960b-b09300e40d6f/phone-number-1.png) ![phone-number-2.png](https://e02.insite.com/files/web/a53ae6fb-9834-4fd4-960b-b09300e40d6f/phone-number-2.png)

* BUT if you put **more** than **11 digits** in any of the number fields, our system converts it to a straight number, no characters.
**Example:**  1234567890123
