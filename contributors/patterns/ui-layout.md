# UI Layout

## Page layouts

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Admin" %}
The **Admin** area serves as the comprehensive management interface for system administrators and instructors who need full control over the learning environment.&#x20;

This area prioritizes functionality and efficiency, featuring dense information layouts, advanced configuration options, and administrative tools.&#x20;

The design emphasizes clear data hierarchies, robust navigation systems, and streamlined workflows that enable power users to quickly access deep system functionality.&#x20;

Interface elements should support complex tasks like user management, course authoring, analytics review, and system configuration while maintaining clarity even with high information density.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Portal" %}
The **Portal** area provides the core learning experience for authenticated learners engaging with course content and educational activities.&#x20;

This learner-focused environment emphasizes clean, distraction-free layouts that promote focus and engagement with educational materials.&#x20;

The design should prioritize content readability, intuitive progress tracking, and seamless navigation between learning modules.&#x20;

Interface elements should support various learning modalities while maintaining a welcoming, accessible experience that encourages continued engagement and learning progression.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Lobby" %}
The **Lobby** area serves as the first impression and entry point for unauthenticated visitors exploring the system.&#x20;

This public-facing space focuses on clear value proposition communication, easy navigation to key information, and frictionless pathways to registration and login.&#x20;

The design should balance marketing appeal with professional credibility, featuring prominent calls-to-action, accessible content previews, and trust-building elements.&#x20;

Interface layouts should be optimized for conversion while providing sufficient information for users to understand the platform's offerings and benefits.
