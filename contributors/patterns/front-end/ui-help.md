# General UI style guide

## Tooltips

Tooltips provide brief, contextual help for UI elements. They should be concise, scannable, and easy to understand.

**Tone:**

* Use a clear, neutral, and instructional tone.
* Avoid jargon, unless it is widely understood by users.

**Length:**

* Aim for one sentence or less.
* Avoid multiple sentences or blocks of text.

**Punctuation:**

* **Do not use ending punctuation** (like periods) **for short phrases or fragments**.\
  &#xNAN;_&#x45;xample: "Displays on the learner's dashboard"_
* **Use a period** if the tooltip is a complete sentence.\
  &#xNAN;_&#x45;xample: "This text appears under the achievement title."_

**Grammar:**

* Use sentence case (capitalize the first word).
* Use active voice when possible.

**Examples:**

* ❌ "this text will be shown under the achievement title."
* ✅ "This text appears under the achievement title."
* ✅ "Appears under the achievement title"
