# Technical Job Descriptions

A technical group is typically comprised of these roles (listed alphabetically):

* Chief Technology Officer
* DevOps Engineer
* Platform Architect
* Software Developer
* Software Engineer

The composition of a technical group evolves and adapts over time, of course, as the needs of the organization change.

The distinction between a software developer and a software engineer is subtle but important. Here is a summary of the key differences:

| <h4 id="developer">Developer</h4>                                                                                             | <h4 id="engineer">Engineer</h4>                                                                                   |

| Responsible for completing those tasks, and writing the code that helps bring software to fruition.                           | Architects of a project and typically create an outline with specific tasks to accomplish throughout development. |
| Use their artistic skills and creative thinking to write functional programs.                                                 | Use engineering concepts and systematic processes to create software.                                             |
| Collaborate with clients on a smaller scale, ensuring a particular design is functional and in line with the client's vision  | Interact with clients and communicate the overarching plan of action for a project.                               |
| Employ a creative approach to solving problems by applying knowledge from external sources, such as personal experimentation. | Rely on scientific and mathematical protocols to analyze problems and create technological solutions.             |

### Growth <a href="#current-group-structure" id="current-group-structure"></a>

As an organization grows, the structure of the group is likely to take shape something like this, with three key departments:

* Engineering
* Development
* Operations
* Research
