# Software Developer

### Summary <a href="#summary" id="summary"></a>

Software developers use their knowledge of programming languages to design and implement software applications. They execute development plans by documenting features, analyzing concepts, and running tests to optimize software. Developers also use their artistic and creative-thinking skills to build and improve application features and to solve technical problems that arise in software.

Because they are responsible for more than writing code, software developers have a clear understanding of the intention and structure of software. The scope of work for software developers may be more focused than that of software engineers, because this allows them to apply their creativity more consistently. By focusing on smaller-scale tasks, software developers can specialize in particular areas of the development cycle, such as specific programming languages or front-end or back-end development.

### Essential Skills <a href="#essential-skills" id="essential-skills"></a>

Software developers are expected to write code that is easy to read and maintain. Proficiency in the following programming languages is necessary: C#, PowerShell, TSQL, JavaScript, and TypeScript.

It is also useful for developers to have experience with agile software development best practices and test-driven development, and to have a working knowledge of web development frameworks and programs such as jQuery, and ReactJS.

Creativity is an essential quality to have as a developer, because implementing reliable and responsive web designs is a regular day-to-day work responsibility.

A detail-oriented mindset and work ethic, proven knowledge of how to develop an application's front-end or back-end, and experience with software development tools, workflows, and programs are essential, along with excellent communication skills. Even though software developers typically work independently, they are still part of a team.

### Primary Responsibilities <a href="#primary-responsibilities" id="primary-responsibilities"></a>

As a software developer, you can expect your primary duties to include meeting with clients about their software needs, and collaborating with management and other departments in the workplace to identify end-user requirements and specifications. When designing and implementing software features, software developers create algorithms and flowcharts, and produce efficient code based on business requirements. They analyze system behaviour and system data to identify potential defects and resolve issues.

Software developers are also responsible for testing the quality and consistency of software. They do so by writing and troubleshooting tests, debugging issues, assessing user experience and feedback, and refining software components like security and data storage. Software developers also create technical documentation that helps guide future software development work. Through the analysis of user and business feedback, they can recommend improvements to software systems.

### Progression Levels <a href="#progression-levels" id="progression-levels"></a>

The levels of progression in this role are cumulative. In other words, a software developer at Level II is understood to be proficient in all components for Level I and Level II, and may (or may not) be proficient in components for Level III. Similarly, a software developer at Level II is understood to be proficient in all components for all three levels.
