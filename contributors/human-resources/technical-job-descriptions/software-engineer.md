# Software Engineer

### Summary <a href="#summary" id="summary"></a>

Software engineers use engineering principles to design, develop, maintain, test, and evaluate software, including computers or other devices containing software. They are knowledgeable in multiple programming languages. Typically, software engineers use their science and math skills to analyze problems and develop solutions methodically.

Software engineers create, execute, and manage all components of a producte during the development lifecycle. This responsibility also requires them to communicate and delegate tasks within a team. Collaboration is essential to deliver functioning and effective software adequately. They may also be responsible for refining past designs to correct defects or address new and changing client needs.

### Essential Skills <a href="#essential-skills" id="essential-skills"></a>

We expect software engineers to working knowledge and experience in computer science, advanced mathematics, pattern design, cloud-based systems, automated testing, multi-core central processors (CPUs), and fault-tolerant systems. Experience in IT architecture, large-scale data stores, and debugging software and systems, domain-specific languages, and pipelines is also an asset.

As software engineers oversee every element of a project, having proven leadership skills, management abilities, and the ability to work both independently and as part of a team can better your chances of getting an interview. This type of profession also requires the ability to evaluate, devise solutions, and have analytical skills that can help you reach strategic objectives. The industry standard is for software engineers to have a working knowledge of several programming languages, such as Python, C++, and Javascript.

### Primary Responsibilities <a href="#primary-responsibilities" id="primary-responsibilities"></a>

The primary duties for a software engineer will, in part, depend on the organization or project, but there are several standard responsibilities you can expect to have in this role. Software engineers analyze the needs of the clients and the users by supporting the entire development cycle of a product. They do so by working across different departments, giving technical guidance, and creating various diagrams, flowcharts, and models that illustrate the type of code needed for programmers.

To ensure the end product meets the clients' and users' expectations, software engineers liaise with the QA team to develop test plans and document each aspect of a system or application as reference for future upgrades and maintenance. Maintenance is an essential aspect of software development for client and customer satisfaction, because bugs can be found during or after the completion of a project. A knowledgeable software engineer understands how to account for bug fixes when estimating how long it may take to complete a project.
