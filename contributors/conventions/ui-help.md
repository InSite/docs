# Style guide

## Overview

As a general rule, we follow the principles and practices in Google's Material Design style guide. Any time you are uncertain about how to proceed with a style decision, please refer to to it for guidance.

The official reference is here: [Material Design style guide](https://m3.material.io/foundations/content-design/style-guide/ux-writing-best-practices)

## Tabs

The sequence of the tabs on a form should follow this basic rule:

Primary/essential content → Secondary content → Advanced/optional content

Tabs should represent a logical information architecture, and should use progressive disclosure (don't overwhelm with too much detail on the first tab).

For example:

* Basic Info (required, foundational)
* Advanced Settings (optional, builds on basic)
* Permissions (contextual, depends on other settings)
* Review (summary, final step)

## Buttons

### Placement

Button placement depends on the specific context and type of action. **Bottom placement** is preferred for:

* **Form submission buttons** (Save, Submit, Continue) - users expect these at the bottom after completing the form
* **Wizard/stepper navigation** (Next, Previous, Finish)
* **Modal dialogs** - actions typically appear at the bottom
* **Mobile interfaces** - bottom placement is more thumb-friendly

**Top placement** is preferred for:

* **Page-level actions** (Create New, Add Item, Export)
* **Toolbar actions** (Edit, Delete, Share) that apply to the entire page or selected content
* **Navigation actions** that don't require form completion
* **Destructive actions** that you want to separate from form submission buttons

Material Design principles specify:

* **Forms**: Primary actions should be at the bottom, following the natural completion flow
* **Content pages**: Actions can be at the top in app bars or floating action buttons
* **Mobile**: Consider reachability - bottom placement is often more accessible

### Alignment and Sequence

On web forms, buttons should be placed at the bottom of the page, aligned to the left margin. The correct sequence (from left to right) is:

1. **Save** (primary action - leftmost)
2. **Cancel** (dismissive action - next to primary)
3. **Duplicate** (secondary action)
4. **View References** (secondary action)
5. **Delete** (destructive action - rightmost or separated)

The key principle here is:

* **Primary actions go first** (leftmost) in the natural reading flow
* **Dismissive actions** (e.g., Cancel) typically appear next to the primary action
* **Destructive actions** (e.g., Delete) are placed last or visually separated

This follows the logic that users read left-to-right and encounter the most important action first. The "Save then Cancel" pairing at the beginning creates a clear primary action hierarchy.

When it is possible to do so, buttons that perform destructive actions should be separated entirely. For example, a Delete button should be placed in a different area of the form, rather than mixing it with form submission buttons.

## Confirmations

The prompt for confirmation of a destructive action should look like this:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Tooltips

Tooltips provide brief, contextual help for UI elements. They should be concise, scannable, and easy to understand.

**Tone:**

* Use a clear, neutral, and instructional tone.
* Avoid jargon, unless it is widely understood by users.

**Length:**

* Aim for one sentence or less.
* Avoid multiple sentences or blocks of text.

**Punctuation:**

* **Do not use ending punctuation** (like periods) **for short phrases or fragments**.\
  &#xNAN;_&#x45;xample: "Displays on the learner's dashboard"_
* **Use a period** if the tooltip is a complete sentence.\
  &#xNAN;_&#x45;xample: "This text appears under the achievement title."_

**Grammar:**

* Use sentence case (capitalize the first word).
* Use active voice when possible.

**Icons:**

* Including an icon is optional.
* When you include an icon in a tooltip, follow a consistent semantic hierarchy:
  * <i class="fa-circle-question">:circle-question:</i> question mark for help/documentation
  * <i class="fa-circle-info">:circle-info:</i> info for basic information
  * <i class="fa-lightbulb-on">:lightbulb-on:</i> lightbulb for insights and quick tips

**Examples:**

* ❌ "this text will be shown under the achievement title."
* ✅ "This text appears under the achievement title."
* ✅ "Appears under the achievement title"

## Grids

Action icons in data tables and grids should be placed in the **right-most column**.

This follows the natural reading flow (left-to-right in most languages) where users first scan the data content and then encounter the actions they can take on that data. There are some exceptions:

* **Selection controls** (like checkboxes) are typically placed in the left-most column
* In some cases, a single primary action icon might be placed on the left if it is the most important element for that row

The right-aligned approach for action icons is part of Material Design's broader principle of creating a clear visual hierarchy and intuitive user flow in a data-dense interface element.
